In this experiment, we will try to predict if there would be a ‘sharp fall’ or ‘crash’ in Gold Prices over next 22-Day period.
We would be using a classification technique for this experiment. We will also learn how to use the trained model to make a prediction on new data every day.
The steps for this exercise would be:

1. Import and shape the data — This would be similar to what was explained in the Regression Experiment Notebook. You can also use the final Training dataset from the Data folder.

2. Define ‘sharp fall’ in Gold Prices. Sharp is not an absolute measure. We will try to define ‘sharp fall’ objectively

3. Create Label — Based on the definition of ‘sharp fall’, we would create labels on historical data

4. Train models to predict the ‘sharp fall’ and use trained model to make prediction on new data
